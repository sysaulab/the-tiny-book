# Universal Morality

God is the ultimate emergent phenomenon[^1]. Smaller gods can exist[^2] too. Complexity is Good[^3]. Discrimination[^4] is the attribution of arbitrary value to other systems[^5]. Supremacism[^6] is energy[^7] distribution discrimination.

[^1]: What I have decided to call God is the theoretical emergent phenomenon that emerges from every interactions within the universe. Although it is rooted in reality, it is impossible to prove its existence and is therefore also compatible with the main religions of the world. Here is something we all have in common, we simply give different names to the same concept. I hope my God can help bridge some differences. 

[^2]: Any complex system on which I depend upon can be a god to me. The sun, nature, food and my toilets are all equally godly. The Creator God could hide behind big bang. The intervening God could have influenced the cosmic microwave background radiation. The God we pray to, individually or collectively, has been found is in the brain.

[^3]: 300% less rules than Isaac Asimov’s robot law. Everything that promotes the emergence of greater, more complex phenomenons (ex.: life) must be cultivated and nurtured. Complexity leads to life. More complex life allow imagination. Greater imagination allow better comprehension of the world. Therefore we must do everything* we can to preserve the conditions that allow life to emerge. *Including being more patient and thinking much more before taking actions.

[^4]: We use discrimination to establish the value of others systems relative to us and between themselves. The rules are dictated by the individual’s ideology.

[^5]: Other systems can mean anything. Other people or living being or objects. It can manifest as money, racism, colonial humanitarianism, etc.

[^6]: It is beneficial for life to favour self preservation. Supremacism is the brutal domination of others to avoid one’s fears. *I mean by that the perception of one self in regards towards it’s environment. Given the chaotic nature of the universe, it is impossible for anything to be the Best. One is the best at accomplishing a task within a given context. We should therefore discuss fitness when discussing anything, especially ideologies. The inability to perceive it’s now unfitness is what leads to war. Any ideology that claims to be superior is declaring war on all other ideologies. If you feel PERSONALLY THREATENED when your ideology is criticized, you are a supremacist. Supremacism leads to wars, wars pollutes, pollution threatens life, supremacism is suicidal in its nature. Supremacism is the belief by an individual that his being or a thought that inhabits him is superior in the absolute… The absolute is not a trait of the Universe, it is irrational to believe that anything can be superior to anything in the absolute. Racial supremacism fuelled old-fashioned political empires and is allowing migrant workers to be a thing. (It’s okay, they are not like us, they are used to it, etc) Ideological supremacism allow justification for wars. Economical supremacism allow billionaires to exist. Sexual supremacism is rape… with the biological emergence twist. When we make a judgement on another person, we must have a fundamentalist or supremacist ideology to rationalize the act of discrimination. After all, we use our own values that we project upon the world to judge others. In this sense, when poverty makes us uncomfortable and we want to make it disappear by enriching the poorest, we perpetuate the same old unhealthy colonial gesture using different words and concepts. If you take for granted that the rest of the world works according to our ideals, or should if it is not the case, you are supremacist. No need to involve skin colour or language to be supremacist. One sign of it is the irrational desire to have more stuff than other people.

[^7]: Energy is limited. Inflation is the creation of imaginary potential energy without any concern towards the resources needed to deliver on that promise. Financialization is toxic to civilization.
