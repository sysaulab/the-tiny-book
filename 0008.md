# Capital-Consumerism

Everything can be bought[^1] and sold, more[^2] is better. Social cohesion[^3] is maintained through fear[^4] and abundance[^5].[^6] Economics[^7] is greed[^8]’s PR agent[^9].

[^1]: By working for his money, the consumer acquires morality for the acquisition and use of his share of surplus energy. As long as his actions are within the limits of the legal system he has no reason to doubt his actions. He will be able to accumulate and spend money as he pleases without worrying about the consequences of his actions. Local morality is preserved.

[^2]: Capitalism rewards greed by assigning more power to those who dominate the most goods. Consumerism rewards abuse by using the economy as an interface that allows wealth to pass without morally staining itself with the abusive gestures necessary for the existence of the consumer society at first.

[^3]: By meeting the ever-increasing demands of consumers, capitalists must find an ever-increasing amount of energy and minerals. This leads to wars for the resources, explained to their own population as humanitarian interventions. It is important to shield the consumer from the immorality of their actions. We risk losing social cohesion and enter a state of revolutionary changes. Losing access to resources means the end of the distribution of undue privileges used to reward ideological loyalty and maintain social coherence. Look at what is happening in Sahel and how France is reacting to it. This ideology appeared during the rising phase of the oil boom, a recent moment in history when fossil energy was increasingly overabundant. By organizing society around the consumption of material goods and promoting free enterprise, this company finds a wide variety of uses for the vast energy surplus available. This requires a lot of energy to maintain and create a need to justify having “national interests” in other countries. The army is used to gain access to these external interests and a thin veil of humanism is painted to make war tolerable. This requires the population to be subjected to a specific version of reality and explains the real reason for the large amount of national secrets within public administration. By putting the consumer at the centre of society and claiming the right to buy what he wants from the consumer, Wall Street’s economic empire is a threat to the rest of life on earth. This threat is explained internally that it is others who are threatening because they envy or hate us. The important thing is to continue shopping, otherwise the terrorists win. The great war that hangs in our face is the concrete result of the unreasoned belief in the American dream. It requires the destruction of the rest of the world simply to extend its unsustainable existence for one more generation.

[^4]: The homeless class serves as example to keep others in line. The police to remind who is the boss. through Corruption (share the undue(stolen) energy for ideological compliance ) and Violence.

[^5]: See: corruption, waste.

[^6]: The net effect of this system is to transform nature into consumer goods. Once the process is completed, we will know the exact value of everything that has been destroyed in the name of an easy and supposedly happier life. With the conflicts it has generated, we could say that it has a debt to pay towards biological complexity. Fortunately for us, if we leave nature alone for a little while, it will do the work for us. The most difficult thing will be to learn how to hold back.

[^7]: The Classical kind. If your economic model does not consider the physical world, you are managing imaginary fairy dust and using that to justify a very wasteful existence. You are a perfectly rational economic agent. The piece that allow society to be more predictable by teaching simple rules (fun is good, money allow fun, money is good) to make the individual behaviour more predictable. Not saying it’s good or bad. Just that it is. It certainly helps create cohesion at large scale at the expense of creativity. But again, I digress…

[^8]: My assumption is that mankind is good and must learn war and exclusion through ideological indoctrination. Religion teaches you to fear different ideas and money rewards greediness. Therefore, greed comes from using money and not the other way around. How the greedy peoples convinced the non-greedy people that is was ok to keep more than we need baffles me, but we are here today and the cycle has been going for a long time… I have no expectation of breaking it on the short term. Humans are way too selfish for this.

[^9]: Humans like to share, money teaches greed. They are just making sure we don’t feel bad about ourselves when our wealth generates negative externalities.
