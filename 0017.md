# Some COs

A few ideas of institutions required to support my citizen led civilization. The goal is to create institutions we control, not people we delegate power to.

## PeaceCO

The Peace Cooperation Organization

Provide observation and support to citizen-lead initiatives for armed conflict resolution. The scientific method will be used to improve the methodology over time. The objective being complete demilitarization over time.

## LifeCO

The Life Cooperation Organization

A Lifer is someone who integrates his life with the coop to share his wealth. This way he can live a worry-free existence that respect the environment and everyone else around him profit from his generosity making him popular, what all rich people are seeking. This plan can work for the benefit of everyone on the condition to accept that money is not important, only the physical world counts.

Examples of alternative local economies:

Everyone else must agree on the fulfillment of my desires. If I want a new laptop, I will have to debate it instead of just using money. And I will have to vote on other’s unnecessary spendings too. Everyone participates, nobody can claim unfair.
Just a percentage is shared…
Let your imagination go wild!.

## SolidCO

The solidarity organization providing the interest-free no-deadlines loans to seed the coop movements. This is the application of solidarity between the CO.

## HealthCO

Basic health care clinics… someone knowledgeable about it should chip in. I think the focus should be on efficient basic care.

## Cloudless services

Decentralized distributed services based on Tox. Community servers with neighbourhood redundancy. Mitigation and exchange of services and goods. (Rides, delivery, car rental, housing). Personal messaging / Distributed backups / Neighbourhood servers. By relocating and distributing services, we reduce our dependence on central services and increase the resilience of our societies in general.
