# Energy

Energy mediates interactions within and between systems. Greed is the wilful ignorance[^1] of other systems and their needs. Energy outside[^2] of me is said to be exosomatic. In my[^3] current economic system, money[^4] represents energy. A system that depends on another system for its energy could be imagined as domesticated[^5]. For more information, seek Nate Hagen[^6] or Jean-Marc Jancovici[^7].

[^1]: To me, rich people are like children who have found a logical trick to justify privileged access to the cookie jar and decides to exploit it rather than solve it. I do not trust any of them. In my eyes, they have the moral elevation of a 3-year-old when we transpose their actions to a human level. Associating unreasonable accumulation with a trait of intelligence or success is a monumental mistake. It is not necessary to be Intelligent to be rich, but it is certainly necessary to possess, at a minimum, a supremacist attitude to justify the blatant injustice required to accumulate so much in the first place. 

[^2]: Commanding exosomatic energy sounds like slavery to me. The higher productivity is not the result of the worker, the additional productivity comes from a resource external to humans. The owner have no claims but the time he used to put the business together. The higher efficiency should always be directed towards the greater good possible. It is disrespectful for one system to claim credit for work done by another system. How is it different than a CEO claiming the value by its workforce for the company by claiming an extravagant lifestyle fuelled by petroleum or by rationalizing being worth a million humans. I therefore propose that the time invested by everyone be the only thing that matters to measure our investment in the collective project. The result of the work, carried out by exosomatic energies should always be directed towards the greatest common good, since this is where the energy required for its execution comes from.

[^4]: Money represents energy, spent or potential. Money only have value if energy is available to render the services and goods desired. Ideally, money would be created just enough to represent the current surplus, split equally to cover basic needs and have whatever’s left be used for humble luxuries. As a whole, the economy consumes all the natural resources (real richness) it can and transforms it into products. When we are pushed to its logical conclusion, we could imagine the economy as a complex machine whose task is to attribute the value of nature by destroying all this. Thinking about money as an accumulator is poorly guided, what matters is physical energy. As for money in another way, we must believe in an illusion. In an ideal world, we would simply calculate everything in joules and use the available surplus to generate the available spending money based on our achievements.Money is a tool of mass discrimination. To use it, it is invariably necessary to assign value to things and people. This is the only way to justify its use and consequences.The act of paying people a different salary according to arbitrary criteria is not different, fundamentally, from the eugenic theories that classified people according to the shape of their skulls. The same fundamental mechanism allows humans to rationalize genocide. We could rationalize that eliminating money would inoculate human societies against fundamentalism and supremacism. The richer you are, the more psychopathic you must be to justify the extent of discrimination required to maintain this state. I have pity on these people, it must be very uncomfortable intellectually. It’s the same colonial bullshit where some people think it’s acceptable to impose their will on the world because they have more money than others. A rich man is a complex system that wastes (consumes more energy than he needs) to project pleasure (maintaining an oversized ego and reorganizing the real world around his beliefs). I would certainly never visit the house of a billionaire, I feel much safer with the population.
