# Communitism

By putting the community[^1] first, I[^2] think we can create a new hybrid[^3] economic model that adapts[^4] to localities[^5] while allowing central coordination where it makes sense. While the internal economics of each coop is no concern to me, I favour solidarity[^6].

[^1]: Once accommodated, a person is no longer homeless. Once fed, a person becomes vigorous. Once these fragile lives are stabilized, who knows how they will choose to use their lives. Above all, they will have gained also have the opportunity to sponsor others who need it. 

[^2]: My objective is to offer an alternative to the status quo without having to go through a sudden shock therapy (war) to address the resource allocation crisis we are facing. My solution solves the fundamental issues over the long term, our dear leaders seems hell bent on ignoring reality at all cost. When a fundamentalistâ€™s own definition of the world (sacred words) does not match the observed reality, the reaction is often to try and change reality (war) rather than face reality (introspection). 

[^3]: Community-sized economic units operating with solidarity internally and interfacing with the greater economic system as a single unit. The organization of life is structured around essential goods and services. The founding principle of the co-op is to organize communities around life activities. If my book makes me rich, my Community will be very well funded. In practice it means that after putting enough money aside to cover for my needs for the rest of my life, the surplus will be used to help my neighbours do the same. As the Community finish paying its debts and accumulate more surplus than needed, the surplus can used to help other communities do the same. Less desperate people means less opportunity for abuse. This model also allow for sponsoring living space with the surplus and tackle homelessness not with cheap rents, but by opening a path to ownership and dignity. I will not have the burden of having to learn to live like a billionaire because nothing will change on my side, the co-op will continue to provide what I need to live, but with this additional contribution, the co-op will be able to sponsor the lives of those who need it most.

[^4]: Promotes the principles of solidarity between neighbouring co-ops. Reduces excessive or unnecessary expenses by pooling resources and tasks. Promote non-paid activities for members. Allows carbon-neutral occasional trips and adventures. One or two people can maintain the land of all members, develop collective kitchen plans to achieve the energy savings required to achieve sustainability. 

[^5]: Local laws have precedence over national laws (true freedom) to recognize the importance of local adaptation over the desire of uniformity required by centralized planning. The other way around is a form of domination with the illusion of freedom.

[^6]: Lifers are those who have contributed enough to no longer have to work. These people can choose to do so nevertheless and help other members achieve this status or sponsor the status of disadvantaged people. The objective is to motivate the rich and less rich to mix their lives to create a reasonably comfortable future capable of lasting millennia. As future progress progresses, we will reintegrate aspects of our lives when we can do it sustainably.
