# Systemism?

The rule: You[^1] must respect[^2] other systems[^3].

*The prayer: The world is composed of simple elements out of which complexity emerges. I must protect the emergent complexity and the mechanisms that allow its emergence.*

The end.[^4]

[^1]: The inclusive you, that includes me. Not the me who is reading, that is you. The me who is writing who is you to me from the frame of reference of the reader. Relativistic writing can get confusing.

[^2]: I will not fall into the trap of define respect here. The whole point of this is to get humans to think for themselves and avoid the traps (easy life) laid by fundamentalist systems (do not think, do as you are told). 

[^3]: You can believe anything you want on top of that, I donâ€™t care.

[^4]: Nothing more is needed, but nothing stops anyone to be systemist-islamist or systemist-christian. The point is to force us to focus on our similarities instead of looking for what divides us right away. Our commonalities allows us to collaborate, our differences allows us to face diverse situations. Diversity is essential to survival.
