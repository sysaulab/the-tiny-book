# My peace process

When I search solutions for world peace[^1], I place restrictions upon myself. It helps me vectorize[^2] my creativity while seeking a durable solution for world peace. It must be universal[^3] and respectful[^4] of the physical[^5] world and[^6] perceived[^7] reality[^8].

[^1]: Until recently, I assumed everyone was doing it too… We should at least keep it in our minds and refrain from judging those who still want to make it happen. The nihilistic perspective required to refute the possibility of peace can only* be the result of constant exposure to a supremacist ideology. *My opinion and I stick to it.

[^2]: Guide. Imagine creativity as a cloud of interactions constantly searching new way to assemble things. The more things you know, the more combinations you can imagine. By vectorizing, I mean giving it a direction by defining the objective ever more precisely. This usually transform my creative process from self centred to purposeful. I think an engineer would call that design by constraint. It can be very effective against the white page syndrome. And if you have nothing to say, maybe not writing this day is the thing to do when we really take the time to think about it.

[^3]: By that I mean to find a solution that apply to all cultures, sexes, races, religions, faiths, species, dimensions and so on. The more generic the rule the more universal it can be. In science, fundamental laws don’t require exceptions. Look at the laws humans have implemented… my god, so complicated. It is as if some people decided to make it complicated by design. Almost as if complicated rules were crafted the rich to ensure nobody without money can enter their playing field. That favoured the rich ones were  who can afford teams of lawyers can get away with almost anything while the rest of us have to feel bed when we transgressed one of the thousands rules that govern the day of an ordinary worker in North-America. If I was sarcastic I would say that this is economic supremacism destined to replace the racial segregation regime in words but use a different mechanism to achieve the same goal. The fact that the net result is mostly the same is completely irrelevant and always just a coincidence. Therefore this note is completely irrelevant.

[^4]: If you condense the essence of most religions, this is what you obtain. Humans like to create complex rules to allow themselves to carry a superior attitude without having to feel bad about it. Not unlike south Africa when we think about it. You know what, just go and watch some old George Carlin, it it still very relevant because the guy was working on fundamental traits. 

[^5]: Science is a methodology to discover laws that predict interactions in our environment and ourselves. To pretend that one can is not dependant on its environment is a terrible mistake. Not only does that require some arrogance and discrimination to accomplish, but it can lead to behaviours that seems ok locally but are clearly a net toxic addition to the whole. 

[^6]: Violence displaces the problems. Earth being a closed system is means it will reemerge somewhere else or later on. Another allegory is the Aquarium war. First, imagine two aquariums in you imagination. The first aquarium is installing a tube with a pump to maintain a higher level of water. That is supremacism. When the other tank try to pump some water back it becomes war. Peace is a single connection without any pumping to let the levels regain balance over time. When all the water is pumped, it becomes a genocide.

[^7]: Sudden large scale changes in the ideological world (shock doctrine) will invariably encounter restrictions that requires energy (application of violence or corruption) to counteract. The most efficient solution must be pacifist in its nature and voluntary. The adoption must be because it works better for them, not because “its good for you, trust me”. By leading by example I wish to convince fellow wealthy and smart people to adopt my philosophy.
