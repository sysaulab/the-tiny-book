# Capitalism or Communism?

What would Jesus say?[^1]

*“I don’t care how humans settle debts between themselves, as long you do it peacefully…”*

[^1]: I imagined a comedy bit where Jesus comes back to earth today… Of course returning in Occupied Palestine could prove to be difficult, so why not make a press conference in New York instead. Of course we have to assume nobody imprison or sedate Jesus for being himself, so he would probably have to be sneaky to keep the freedom to do his work. Assuming all goes ok and we finally have a press conference, one of the questions aside from the heaven one is probably about the what system is better: capitalism or communism? Personally I think they are both misguided, and [stakeholder-capitalism](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/from-principle-to-practice-making-stakeholder-capitalism-work) is not any better. After all, [if McKinsey is selling it, it is probably morally corrupt](https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/season-10/14-october-22-2023-mc-kinsey). To me, the fundamental problem behind all of these three organizational structure is the fact that they are all very tall hierarchies. Fundamentally, if we ignore concepts and observe things without cultural filters, they are structures that allow a few individuals to control the life of many individuals. The distinction reside only in the arbitrary criteria to determine who is most qualified. In a sense, they are all Elitists with different flavours. I am not saying that this is bad or good, I am saying they have more in common than we care to admit, and the planned replacement plan seems worse. The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/)‘s goal of using stakeholder-capitalism to make a more equal and sustainable society is laudable but I deeply disagree with [Klaus Schwab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schwab)‘s methods. After examination it seems to me the ecological component is accessory to the fact and it is a much more political agenda. This is what Trumpist are fighting against and I applaud their will to do so. The [jewish-space-laser-Qanon-shit-fest](https://x.com/RepMTG) is not helping any more than the identity diversions used my the [political left to hide the fact they stopped caring about workers decades ago](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/the-influence-of-elites-interest-groups-and-average-voters-on-american-politics/). My plan is to get rich by selling stuff on this website and use this money to buy the building where I currently rent. Then I will transfer ownership to a coop that will become my new hybrid economical agent: the community. My community will operate using internal solidarity but external greediness. That will ensure we stay focused on a good life, not an extravagant one. It allow me to see my money being invested where I live, solving the problem of surrendering it to a faceless government, or worse, an AI. In my coop, the rent serves to pay back the building to me, except I will surrender that money again to another entity, the Help Cooperation Organization, who will use the money to help other neighbourhoods do the same by providing interest-free and deadline free loans. The focus is on finding a local way to live more responsibly, the objective being not using more energy (including energy to create stuff you buy and move it around until its on your house) than necessary. This idea came to me when I was listening an episode of Nate Hagen‘s The Great Simplification ([Staying Warm with Nora Bateson](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/frankly-original/20-keeping-warm-data)) discuss the impact of high energy prices. The idea of collective kitchen is alien to us but we love going to the restaurant. The collective kitchen can be a restaurant in which every coop full member can eat free of charge to encourage collective cooking. Non members just pay the regular price and money is used to improve the coop. My hope is for this model to solve homelessness by making everybody an owner and solve ecology by helping the people around me retire early (by enabling community-wide economies of scale we can do much more with the shared pool of cash, including helping those who require it). The neighbourhood itself continues to act as a rational economic actor, I think at that level it makes sense. The biggest impediment is to convince people it can be done, that is why I want to lead by example.
