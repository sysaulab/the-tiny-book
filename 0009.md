# Fundamentalism

A belief[^1] that some words[^2] are more important[^3] than reality[^4]. We all appreciate when being listened to. The fundamentalist can only speak.

[^1]: Capitalism is also a belief. No scientific foundation whatsoever...

[^2]: Sacred text, foundational myths.

[^3]: I am beginning to think that this is a trait of people who are part of a supremacist ideology. As these individuals are part of a group that claims to be superior in one way or another (American exceptionalism, “God’s people” of Israel, integral Islamism, Capital-consumerism) The fundamentalist thinks anyone not thinking like itself must be mentally deranged or inferior in some way to protect it’s ideological compliance. The supremacist version wages war to other systems who thinks differently.

[^4]: If the prophecies say it must come true, the believer may engage in irrational acts to try realize (from imagination to physical reality) it. In that sense, I see fundamentalism, under all its forms, like a cancer to be eradicated for the benefits of the greater organism (greater humanity).
