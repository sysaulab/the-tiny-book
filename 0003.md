# My ToE

To simplify my philosophy, I imagine everything as an anonymous system (group of interacting, inter-related, or interdependent[^1] elements[^2] forming a complex whole). Systems can be deterministic[^3] or chaotic[^4]. Our brain understands the world linearly[^5].

[^1]: When I encounter words or ideas I don’t understand, I put the book aside and try to learn about it before continuing to read. If I cannot spare the time, I imagine something that seems to fit the context and make sure to read it again later, after I learn more. The silliest idea the better, that way it never becomes an irrational fundamentalistic belief.

[^2]: The observable universe* can be explained as elementary particles from which emerges more complex phenomenons when the conditions are favourable to it. When we talk about the universe as a system, we have to imagine all the interactions happening simultaneously between all its elements. We also know that everything in the universe is unique as no two places look the same. The subatomic system allows the emergence of atomic phenomena. The atomic system allows the emergence of biological phenomena. The biological system allows the emergence of psychological phenomena. This seems to carry over in the social world as individuals collaborating allow communities who can organize as states who forms states and all that makes civilization. We will imagine everything as systems and phenomenons to keep things simple. This will allow us to compare things that do not seem comparable at first glance. For example, we can use the principle of exosomatism to determine the morality of our actions. Exosomatism is that which is external to a system.For example, exosomatic energy can come from a windmill, a river, oil… an animal, another human or even in food before being digested and integrated into our body system.

[^3]: When things interact with each other in a predictable way they are deterministic, otherwise they are chaotic.

[^4]: Chaos can emerge when elements interact concurrently and interdependently without knowledge of the others. I thus hypothesize that if we were to travel back in time and compare events, chaotic uncertainty would resolve differently and introduce divergences compared to the original universe. Let’s imagine a tornado, it has coherence in its form but chaos in its action. It is impossible to predict his actions, so he is not chaotic in his action. The exact form it will take and the exact path taken are the result of many interactions that interact with each other in a closed environment. The fact that it retains a general shape suggests convergent interactions. Their actions seem to follow a unified objective and the form is maintained. When our tornado can no longer maintain its coherence it dies. It usually happens when energy becomes scarce. It is possible for a computer to create a chaotic state using only logical elements. As long as the constituting elements are influencing each others interdependently and simultaneously. You can achieve this by coupling three hash functions together and observing the resulting chaotic phenomenon emerging from it. https://github.com/sysaulab/chaos or type the following if GitHub’s servers do not work. You could also visit my other page [here](https://sysau.art/synthetic-chaos/).

[^5]: A story is a linear sequence of events. It favours the adoption of a “if this then that” ideology. To imagine a what a linear perception looks like in a chaotic system, I like to imagine chaos as a jet engine and the trailing clouds as a historical record. As such I think it is important to respect the fact that other people think and organize differently. It is very important to understand the need for diversity. Like ecological niches, different ideologies are beneficial in different contexts.  The inability to realize it and correct course can lead to supremacism and fundamentalism before war. Capital-consumerism, my own ideology, was very adapted to the raising edge of the petroleum boom but is completely inadequate for the total net usable energy surplus deflation that we expect to mark the coming centuries. I consider this ideology to be a fundamentalist and supremacist cult based on the exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few. In a universal sense, exploitation of natural resources at the expenses of everything that is not human, since they are all systems interacting with each others… require energy… think about it for a while.
