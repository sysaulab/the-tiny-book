# Winning Wars

![My inner representation of war](0011.pdf)

Winning wars lead to supremacism[^1] which cultivate resentment into others. Humanity, as a whole,[^2] cannot win wars. It can only get consumed by them.

[^1]: WW1 domination of Germany lead to WW2 and economic domination of US$. The dominating position of United States lead it to corrupt the international institutions it is entrusted with. What good can come out of WW3?

[^2]: A war is like when one of your organs is trying to dominate the rest. Who wins when the liver destroy half your lungs? Do you think that liver gained the right to tell the rest of the body?
