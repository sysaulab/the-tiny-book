# Intelligencia per se

Intelligence is the ability of any complex system[^1] to modify its configuration according the perception of its environment[^2]. Monsters are intelligent system whose actions have consequences beyond perception[^3]. Greater complexity allows imagination, and with it, curiosity[^4]. When a system refuses to acknowledge its own nature, I consider it to be pretentious[^5]. The moral code of an individual comes mostly from its ancestry[^6] and evolve[^7] over time.

[^1]: Is Venusâ€™ fly trap a plant that shows intelligence? She reacts to her environment and this allows her to feed herself. It does not have the complexity necessary to understand the world. What we currently call Artificial Intelligence is a computer programmed to simulate this process using computers. In some cases, I would not talk about artificial intelligence, but rather Electrological intelligence. In our case, we are therefore talking about Biological Intelligence. If the mind were detached from its original substrate as theorized in popular beliefs, drugs and drugs would have no influence on our perception of the world.

[^2]: In my opinion, consciousness is a complex system capable of internally representing outside reality through sensing capacity. This would essentially means robots should have same rights as humans, or justify slavery, since the two are systematically equivalent.

[^3]: I think this breaks the ability to learn and educate itself, applies to all kind of complex systems like government, billionaires, corporations, etc. It is usually characterized by a tall hierarchic shape. The taller, the more monstrous potential it posses.

[^4]: What is curiosity. Thanks to one of my riders, I will now attempt to define it as a system.Curiosity and liberalism is the same thing to me. Different people have different tolerance to change. This scale of tolerance to change can explain the universal left/right liberal/conservative division across the socio-economic spectrums. What is curiosity. Thanks to one of my riders, I will now attempt to define it as a system. Curiosity and liberalism is the same thing to me. Different people have different tolerance to change. This scale of tolerance to change can explain the universal left/right liberal/conservative division across the socio-economic spectrums. This means that some of us, like me, are much more likely than others to try new things regardless of what other people think. Most of the time these endeavours will not lead to anything interesting or useful. Sometimes something useful to others will come out of it and other people not too afraid of change will adopt the idea. This chain of event represent the chaotic process that allow civilization to learn (evolve) by introducing changes over time and only letting the necessary changes transpire. In that sense we can say that life is extremely curious, but also very cruel towards inefficient systems. In that sense, balanced ecosystems are true models of sustainable closed self-balancing chaotic system. 

[^5]: Some conscious complex system refuses to recognize their nature of its existence. Transsexualism is systematically pretentious by claiming their inner representation should be expressed in the physical reality. Systematically speaking, this is the exteriorization of a fundamental Illusion.

[^7]: It will be adjusted over time to compensate for changes in the environment. I hypothesize the teenage rebellion comes from the environment changing faster than ideologies, creating rifts between generations during times of quick changes. Different ideologies will justify a different moral code depending on the objective to be achieved and the environment of the individual. Here I try to explain the morality of abstract interactions. It may seem abstract, and it is, but there are some things we can learn in general.
