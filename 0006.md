# How to Love Everybody

Loving everyone is easy[^1]. Knowing why[^2] we love a serial rapist[^3] is a bit more difficult. 

[^1]: Since I grew up in a christian culture, I tend to use Jesus as my moral frame of reference. This does not negate the validity of other prophets in any way. Since Jesus is a jew I figured I am allowed to do some creative accounting to get there. I assume that Life, in all its form, is usually Good. I also believe that diversity (in the systematic sense) is key to prosperity because it allow any group to possess more tools to face future challenges. 

[^2]: When my theoretical default of loving everyone does not work, I am forced to look inside me and try to understand why I have that reaction and make sure it is not a perception problem. I refrain to engage in any form of criticism. This usually yields good results. I have seen individuals who engaged in criminal activities transformed by such an influence around them. 

[^3]: In the most extreme cases, I must admit to myself that despite wanting to do good, some people have a perception of reality that do makes then engage in acts that are detrimental to the greater good, therefore detrimental to ourselves.
