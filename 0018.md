# If I was a Jew…

I[^1] would[^2] buy[^3] a house in Tel-Aviv[^4] and[^5] share[^6] it with a Palestinian family[^7] in dire need.

*In spring 2024, a Jewish Temple in Vancouver was on the receiving end of a cocktail molotov. The next Saturday, I was giving a ride to one of its member. He was fashioning a lapel pin featuring the flags of Israel and Canada. I imagined he could be a diplomat and broke the subject. He only wears the pin to break conversation, nothing official. I just had an idea about using abstract systems to rebase a moral framework on universal observations to abstract out any cultural elements and have a true neutral frame of reference. The short ride was not enough to initiate my passenger to the intricacies of my new ideology or even do more than scratch the surface.*

*One thing was very clear to me: he was very frightened. To the point where he was trying to convince me that we should start silencing those who disagree with him. That seems suspiciously supremacist to me, and that is why Israel’s project is making me so uncomfortable.*

[^1]: If I was a Jew and rejected the zionist project, I would be rejected by half of my own people and attacked in my personal life because I disagree with some of my co-believers who went the fundamentalist way.

[^2]: I could quit being a jew and start believing something else that don’t require the threaten the existence of entire populations only not to be afraid. But that strategy concentrate the power in the hands of the radicals who perpetuates the violence. That solution is not morally satisfying to me.

[^3]: I could open up my house to people from Gaza who have lost everything. This demonstrates that the actions of my government does not reflect my will and allow for a tiny bit of healing between the two people. If this gesture could inspire some other Israelites to share their home with Gazan’s it could literally spark a true revolution. This has the potential to liberate Israel from its status of Garrison State to a truly independent nation where all faiths are accepted.

[^4]: If I was a Jew and I believed in the zionist project, I would have to go to Israel without delay and pick up the fight against the enemies of my people. That is, if I am not hypocritical and satisfy myself by shouting my disagreement in unpleasant manner to anyone who disagree with me.

[^5]: The biggest problem I can see is the status of Palestinian within Israel. I am worried it will be impossible for them to enter legally Israel. Since I care about the law I have a solution that would make everyone happy. Let’s (temporarily) convert them to judaism! If all it takes is to convert them to judaism to enter Israel, let’s just (honorarily) grant jewishness to all occupants of Israel. It is only fair since Israel claims to represent all Jews, even those who want nothing to do with it. Reciprocity is important to me.

[^6]: Of course I am not Jewish. Only Jews are allowed to migrate to Israel. If I was to be converted to judaism it would force my hand. I would have to move there, buy a house and host as many Gazan’s as I can afford to, which is less than one at the moment. 

[^7]: Lucky for me I am too poor to organize that sort of thing and my online store is very quiet… Who wants peace? Nobody. Everybody just wants to be special. I feel for God hearing our complaints.
