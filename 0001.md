# About Myself

[^1]Very young, I rejected the idea of God but embraced its message[^2] of pacifism and universality. Late teenager, I left some leftists meeting[^3] vocally disappointed. I worked in communication[^4] and transportation[^5]. This book is formatted to be efficient[^6] and fun[^7].

[^1]: This is an attempt to redefine our view of the world by using systems as founding element of universal moral rules. I don’t think I made a good job at describing it as such so far. I imagine we will need specialized sections describing the different complexity levels of the universe starting with physics and making our way into psychology. Until then, please read wikipedia to fill the blanks or write a comment to make a suggestion. 

[^2]: During the bible studies at school, I could not care less about the stupid stories and supposed miracles, but I was very impressed by the actions of Jesus as a man and Christianity as a bunch of people fighting an empire. This was before the Roman Empire integrated it and it left us with the roman catholic church, biggest affront to God if I would choose to believe in one.

[^3]: Their bickering and lack of focus was disconcerting and led me to believe this was not how I would achieve world peace. Before leaving I said something like that : “I see here people disputing their share of a war before having acquired the weapons required to engage their first battle.” The next day I saw on TV some leftist consortium being announced to fight the Quebec summit more effectively. I always felt bad for not staying and for that I ask forgiveness to my brothers and sisters who decided to stay and fight the good fight. 

[^4]: You* know the people who sits in submarines and operating the radios? This is not what I was doing at all. The technical guy that comes to connect your Internet is also not what I was not doing. The communication field I was in was mostly corporate services… * Technically it was more marketing, except I was not selling a company’s product to the consumers, I was selling the value of a company to shareholders. My title then should have been powerpoint ninja. I also ended up [programming, design, editing, it] at an unnamed YP advertising agency not so far from Metro Peel in downtown Montreal. I don’t remember the exact dates of my employment at that place near Peel, but I do remember walking all the way to Berri-UQAM to realize there was a bomb threat and the yellow line was inaccessible. I was so pissed off I think I used swear words when a local news crew (TVA) asked me about the situation. If anyone is interested in the exact** date the easiest thing to do would be to locate the clip that aired my comments on the news to correlate dates. ** Dating stuff in fun! I not only stuffing dates into pies or having sex with objects, I mean the process of establishing the date something was assembled based on the study of the environment that surrounds it. 

[^5]: My first transportation job was paperboy, the others* were practically the exact same thing with some unimportant distinctions. * I delivered the Voir newspaper until I had an accident with the rental truck. I offered stripper transportation service until I realized the Italian mafia was behind it. I also drove a truck** for almost 10 years. ** At first I was employed in Montreal and working mostly the east coast. I drove almost exclusively dry vans except for my first job as a trucker. It was e refrigerated run between Montreal and California with two drivers. We call that “running teams”. The first two trips were an internship required to obtain my diploma. That was fun, my mentor was very good driver and also a decent human being. After being paired with someone who don’t speak a word of English and another who struggle to not hit the rough edges of the road, I decided that place was not for me and moved on. The second place was a single-driver-dry-van open board across north America. It means I was alone in the truck, pulling a box like trailer 53 feet long and I was not assigned a specific route. At first I was doing mostly trips in the north east. Before long I went almost everywhere. On my first trip to Vancouver BC I fell in love with the place and asked to be transferred there. The trips were much more fun out west. More open space, less traffic. Maybe I will write a book about the crazy adventures that happened to me during that time and tell you about the pant-less hitchhiker in the desert or the little girl with a hole in her her and blood all over her face. But I digress again as this is a text about peace, not me. Moving along…

[^6]: I tried to keep each post very short. Reading the book should only take a minute or two. The footnotes may take a few more minutes to read, but their small size help keep down the size of the buffer needed to represent the information on your computer. Be thankful I don’t have access to microfilm equipment. You can watch a spy movie from the 1960’s if you don’t know what that is. 

[^7]: I have a lot of fun writing those footnotes, I hope you have fun reading them. I would not know, I never read them when I read a book.
