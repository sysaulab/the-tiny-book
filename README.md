# The Tiny Book

The tiny book is an attempt to lay down the philosophy I acquired throughout my life in the smallest footprint possible. 

I strongly believe that humanity can only achieve its full potential through Peace rather than domination. I am hoping to create a space for citizen philosophy with lasting world peace as next objective.
