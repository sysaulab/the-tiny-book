# Wokers are Supremacists

By demanding the right not to be offended[^1], the wokers are adopting a supremacist[^2] attitude that favours the inner group and reject anything that does not conform to their limited view of diversity. This bears more resemblance to a cultural revolution[^3] than a true movement for universal justice. This is why it bothers me so much[^4].

[^1]: *How the {BODY MEMBER IN A BODY CAVITY} am I supposed to know what offends you, or you over there, or anyone really? The only way to not be offended is to uniformize society. Effectively erasing all ideological differences while preserving the appearance of diversity. Multiculturalism is where cultures become commodities. Ideological enforcement uniformize societies and deprive our species of much needed diversity of solutions. See how I did not say fuck? We should have a filter on TVs that replaces the censorship bleeps with a voice over saying “penis in a vagina”. That would be much more pleasant to the ears and educative to the younger ones.* -Me ranting out. It was fun!

[^2]: For example, in my cab the other day, I was listening to a podcast featuring two very prominent, multi-post-doctoral world renowned professors discussing wokism. One of them, in London ON, was telling about the case of a teacher that was sacked for saying “Indian” as in the “Indian Treaty of …”. To be treated as a racist bigot for that? Then my passenger opinionated: “I am well educated and I know we have to use new words now”. All the attention is on the words being used, not the concepts they represents. This little pretentious white ass boy was in effect trying to explain how to name the pre-Columbian civilization that used to be. I dated such a girl and she referred to herself as an Indian, even when we fucked like animals. Was she supposed to feel bad for not using the words that made the uncomfortable white men less guilty? Is it so important that our bigots hate what is different using proper terminology to avoid offending someone.

[^3]: It is such a beautiful tool of social engineering, it allows continued interventions abroad for the humanitarian pretext, divide ourselves into an ever growing number of supposed oppressed minorities. You cannot just be a human who have occasional sex with other sympathetic humans, no, you have to declare yourself part a some tribe that practice sexuality own a very specific way and its important that the rest of us blesses their sexuality in public. Don’t get me wrong, I encourage diversity. I just don’t think labeling and categorizing is the way to go. Generalizing is much more efficient and less prone to conflicts. 

[^4]: While it operates very differently than Nazism or Mao’s cultural revolution, the net result is a fractionating of the west around the blindly naive “Just stop oil” left winger and the “Let me do what I want” right winger. I do not trust any of them have any solution to the emerging wall of problems we are facing.
